👋 Hi, I’m @davidolad
👀 I’m interested in building user-centric mobile and web applications, UI engineering, and exploring scalable software solutions.
🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Flutter development, clean architecture, and cloud integration for mobile apps.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source Flutter projects, mobile/web UI design systems, and community-driven tech initiatives.

⚡ Fun fact: I once fixed a network issue and helped redesign a UI in the same afternoon—tech support meets UI engineering!
